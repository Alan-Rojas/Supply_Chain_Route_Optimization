This project tackled a big operational headache: a green snacks company was relying on a team of promoters to visit over 300 stores across Mexico City. 
💼 Their job? Make sure the products were always well placed — visible, stocked (no run-outs or leftovers), and looking sharp on the shelves.

But Mexico City isn’t exactly a smooth ride. It's chaotic, distances are long, and traffic is brutal. 
🏙️ On top of that, each store required a different number of visits per month, based on demand. 
The company was struggling to manage it all — promoters had disorganized schedules, inconsistent routes, and overall, the system wasn’t cost-effective. 
They knew they were burning time, money, and potential. 
Something had to change.
